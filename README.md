# grellyd_site
Go Site

This my website written in Golang. It was originally based off of the [wiki tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/) for an understanding of routers etc, but has since expanded.

Currently an old version is deployed at [grellyd.com](http://grellyd.com). Since restructuring the packages, the AWS package management doesn't handle internal packages well. Therefore the new version will be the dockerised version of this site.
