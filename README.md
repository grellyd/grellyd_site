# Grellyd_Site
## Golang Website

This my website written in Golang. It was originally based off of the [wiki tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/) for an understanding of routers etc, but has since expanded.

Currently an old version is deployed at [grellyd.com](http://grellyd.com). Since restructuring the packages, the AWS package management doesn't handle internal packages well. Therefore the new version will be the dockerised version of this site. 

## Future Steps:
1. Dockerise the site
2. Redeploy to AWS
3. Append a blog section (Either homemade or perhaps [Journey](https://kabukky.github.io/journey/)?)
4. S3 Bucket for resumes on site
