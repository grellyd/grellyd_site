Facebook does birthdays really well. But what if you dislike using Facebook for birthdays? 

That could be due to repeated privacy and anti-user movements, like [using your two factor authentication cell phone number as an advertising identifier](https://twitter.com/jeremyburge/status/1101402001907372032), or just wanting some independence around managing your contacts.

As part of my move away from using facebook, I updated the vast majority of my contacts to get their true birthdays and preferred emails. As I am buried deep in the Google ecosystem, using Google Contacts was a natural choice.<sup>[1]</sup> I already have my Gmail and telephone contacts there from my Android phone.

When asking friends for their details, I noticed something odd: the birthday field had no formatting control.

### Footnotes

## 1.

Google is also an privacy invading technology company. However personally I place more trust in their services as I believe I am in more control of their usage of my data and have more faith in their agenda.
