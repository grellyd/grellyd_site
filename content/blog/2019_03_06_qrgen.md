I built a small Go wrapper around a QR code generator library as a way to demonstrate fast, private, and independent QR code generation, and as a way to play with cgo bindings to a relatively simple C library.

### The inciting incident

I was contacted by a non-technical friend about the possibility of generating QR codes privately. Many of the services out there are closed source, or actively note they are doing something with your data. This could be sending your data to advertisers, checking sites for malicious intent, or just logging your work. Should you want to generate QR codes for internal use, these services create a gaping security hole.

QR codes have always interested me as they are a simple bridge between the digital and physical worlds. The rise of mobile payments in Asia via WeChat and QR codes is a fascinating case study on how making that bridge convientient and easy to cross facilities innovation.

### How to generate the codes?

Given the challenge, there were three possibilites before me:

1. Find a pre-existing open source service which allows easy QR code generation and easy auditing of its code base.
2. Find a pre-existing open source library, which allows easy auditing, and build a wrapper application around it.
3. From scratch, implement the QR code generation algorithm specified in the ISO standard, and then build the application.

These options increase in time investment and difficulty. 

After a brief and non-exhaustive search for a pre-existing open source service, I quickly found many open source libraries.

### TODOs for commercial release:

- Unit testing.
- Audit the C library for correctness to ISO/IEC 18004:2006 or rewrite in Go.
- Find out the desired bindings (web, app, etc.) and build their interfaces.
