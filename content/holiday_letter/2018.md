Hi all, and happy holidays.

After enjoying my Uncle Doug's yearly holiday letter, and seeing my friends and family get more spread out, I thought I'd give this a try. 

____

This has been a hard year for me. 

(expectations and plans)

Last year I was finishing up my fourth and final coop term at a fintech company here in Vancouver, after going backpacking in Asia for a few months. I had planned a triumphant return to school in January for my final semester; a true victory lap if you will. 


(the hit of the malaise) (from old things bubbling up, after scraping by in a few semesters prior) (change of place and pace are good distractions, but they fix little. This year I've avoided pushing on any dreams, just trying to be myself, be happy, and get motivated again.)

(Generally prioritise people photos over nature)

Extra summer classes and adventures

Highlights:

In the past few months I've started seeing someone new. While its too early to say much more, everything has been pretty fantastic, and I'm quite excited about the direction things are going.

Whatever your faith may be, happy holidays and best of luck in the new year.

Love you all,

Graham
