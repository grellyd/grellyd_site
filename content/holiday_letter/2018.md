Hi all, and happy holidays!

After enjoying my Uncle Doug's yearly holiday letter, and seeing my friends and family get more spread out, I thought I'd give this a try. 
____

This has been a relatively tough year for me.

For those of you who have seen the show, I felt a bit like BoJack Horseman: desponedent, depressed, self-destructive, and building bad habits. I realised I had a minor problem last November, but dragged my feet on doing anything until March/April-ish of this year.

Since then I've done my best to try to give myself space and time to figure out what is wrong, how to manage it, and how to continue on smoothly; how to be better. 

One key component is that I've tried to not 'push' on anything. This meant temporarily abandoning most of my goals and plans heading into this year. I've had some uncomfortable conversations where I was forced to acknowledge that my aims were still just talk.

Two things have really helped: I started going to see a pair of lovely trainers at a gym four times a week, and started to chat to a good counsellor. Working out consistently has been fabulous aid, for it has made me feel the strongest I ever have, and forced me to do basic human things. Plus downsizing my pants by three waist sizes felt great!

I'm happy to report that I'm starting to get a firmer handle on it all, and my plans for the future are opening up again. Soon I'll be able to take what I've just been talking about and put it into action. 

A huge thank you goes to my parents for supporting me through all of this. I would not be able to do any of this without them providing the opportunity to have time and space to work through things.

So where was I last year?

I was finishing up my fourth and final coop term at a fintech company here in Vancouver, after going backpacking in Asia for a few months. I had one term left for school with an expected graduation in May with many of my good friends.

Over spring break, as a getaway from school, I had the opportunity to go visit Jeff and Sue in New York! I spent the entire time chatting with friends over drinks, brunching away, or drinking afternoon tea in a speakeasy. I still don't know what Times Square is like , or been to the Statue of Liberty, but I felt my time was well spent. I felt strangely out of place with my shaggy hair and west coast casual dress. It got to me so much I even got a haircut four days in.

I was stupidly overconfident and didn't both to check my credits for graduation and managed to miss the mark by two credits. To finish up I took two classes over the summer: English Technical Writing (somewhat useful, remote, but boring) and Introduction to Japanese Cinema (super chill and interesting). If I could recommend one film, it would be [Tampopo](https://imdb.com). An exercise I enjoyed was coming up with alternate taglines for the films. For Tampopo, it was Rocky for Ramen. Its also been called a Ramen Western.

In may, as an after grad celebration, Crystal, Radu, and Marina and I did the West Coast Trail together! We got incredibly lucky with the weather, and were treated to seven days of sun, sand, and deep deep mud. Frankly one of the best hiking trips I have ever been on. It makes me excited for the North Coast Trail next year!

Then newly employed Crystal decided to get a dog, and lovely Stella entered our lives!

The fur and dirty paw prints have been a bit to get used to, but she has without a doubt made my life better. She is a warm loving companion and wonderful to have around (especially if you keep feeding her hotdogs). She also is becoming quite the adventure dog, going on many hikes and trips, and recently ski adventures.

If you haven't yet, I would highly suggest you follow her instagram [@gsdstells](https://instagram.com/gsdstells). Its run by Crystal, but I manaage to sneak on there occasionally.



This fall I also met a fabulous new person. While its too early to say much more, dating Viviana has been pretty fantastic, and I'm quite excited about where things are going.

We ended up taking two wonderful road trips back to back: out to Tofino, and then across the face of the province to Jasper/Banff.

Next year I plan to:

* Finish my job search, ideally landing a remote Go/Ruby based backend software developer role.
* Get my drysuit certification and dive in BC
* Hike the North Coast Trail and/or the Bowron Lakes circuit (due to messing up my graduation, I had to cancel these last may)
* Ski tour a lot more, and learn to better read slopes and snow. Frankly getting out and getting home safely will satisfy this for me. A winter overnight would also be a bonus.

There are a vairety of smaller tech projects I'd like to do, people I'd like to visit, and places I'd like to go. However those come in their own time.
