Hi I'm Graham. 

@grellyd most places online.

I'm a twenty-something who likes working on his laptop and adventuring outside. Overall I'm always looking for my next adventure.

If you are looking for my C.V. jump to my [resume](/resume). 

This site functions as a portfolio of my work beyond [Github](https://github.com/grellyd).

### Why Grellyd?

Grellyd stems from my first attempt at a screen name combined with a portion of my middle name: **gre**yham **ll**o**yd**. I can happily say that I am the only thing one finds when they Google 'grellyd'.

### Why Computer Science?

In short, the immense power of using software to solve problems.

After starting at the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca) in 2012 in the Combined Science Program (CSP), I found my way into Computer Science. While I started wanting to be either a pyrotechnic chemist or some international governmental talking head, I was soon dissuaded by their first year classes. After taking a single computer science class on the fundamentals of computation, it was love at first lecture. Learning control flow, code reuse, and testing without 'breaking' the computer was amazing. The class stunned me with the immense power of programming, and a strange sense of freedom.

That winter I made my very first project: a game titled "The Adventures of Twerpicus", a Christmas gift for my girlfriend at the time. She was a huge Zelda fan, and so I made a clone of our CPSC 110 final project, Pacman. I reused some of the display and movement logic from our project and added more features such as levels, power ups, enemies with combat mechanics, and complete custom pixel art. Written in Racket it required special software to run, and was far from groundbreaking. However I was hooked by the pleasure I got building the game and the sense of accomplishment at the end. 

Since then I've gone from class to class, project to project, job to job, with the same sense of wonder, freedom, and power. I am very happy to be in this field, and aim to use this fabulous toolset to create a strong postive impact.
