Hi I'm Graham. @grellyd online in most places. I'm a twenty-something who likes working on his laptop and adventuring outside. Overall I'm always looking for my next adventure.

If you are looking for my C.V., jump to my [resume page](/resume) or go read my [blog](/blog). Items on this site are those which I am happy to present as a portfolio of my work, or a digital profile of sorts.

### Why Grellyd?

Grellyd stems from my first attempt at a screen name (greyham) combined with a portion of my middle name (lloyd): **gre**(yham)**ll**(o)**yd**. I can happily say that I am the only thing one finds when they Google 'grellyd', and I have yet to find a service where the name is already taken. 


### Why Computer Science?

In short, the immense power of using software to solve problems.

After starting at the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca) in 2012 in the Combined Science Program (CSP), I quickly found my way into the Computer Science department (CPSC). While I had entered UBC wanting to be either a pyrotechnic chemist or some international governmental talking head, I was soon dissuaded from those paths by  the first year chemistry and political science classes. After taking a single computer science class on the fundamentals of computation, it was love at first assignment. In the class I was struck by learning how to read code, the idea of code reuse (aka a function), and the ability to run any code without 'breaking' the computer. The class stunned me with the immense power of programming, and a strange sense of freedom.

That winter I made my very first project: a game titled "The Adventures of Twerpicus", a Christmas gift for my girlfriend at the time. She was a huge Zelda fan, and so I made a clone of our CPSC 110 final project, Pacman. I reused some of the display and movement logic from our project and added more features such as levels, power ups, enemies with combat mechanics, and complete custom pixel art. Written in Racket it required special software to run, and was far from groundbreaking. However the pleasure I got building the game and the sense of accomplishment at the end hooked me. My girlfriend's amazement at the gift helped seal the deal.

Since then I've gone from class to class, project to project, job to job, with the same sense of wonder, freedom, and power. I am very happy to be in this field, and aim to use this fabulous toolset to create a good impact.
